IMPORTANT KEYWORDS TERMS AND DEFINITIONS: \par
Demanding Respect\par
Definition: Demanding respect involves insisting on being treated with respect, often through authoritative or forceful means.\par
Characteristics: This approach usually comes across as aggressive or entitled. The person may use their position of power, threats, or ultimatums to ensure they are respected.\par
Example: A manager might say, "You will respect me because I am your boss," without demonstrating why they deserve that respect.\par
Outcome: This often leads to superficial compliance rather than genuine respect. People may follow orders out of fear or obligation, but the underlying respect is not truly present.\par
Commanding Respect\par
Definition: Commanding respect means establishing a presence or authority that naturally encourages others to respect you.\par
Characteristics: This involves confidence, competence, and a strong sense of integrity. The individual does not need to ask for respect; their actions and demeanor inspire it.\par
Example: A leader who is decisive, knowledgeable, and fair might naturally command respect from their team without explicitly requesting it.\par
Outcome: This approach tends to result in genuine respect. People respect the individual because of their capabilities and the way they carry themselves.\par
Earning Respect\par
Definition: Earning respect involves gaining respect through actions, behavior, and how one treats others over time.\par
Characteristics: This is built on mutual understanding, trust, and consistent behavior. The person demonstrates respect for others and, in turn, earns respect.\par
Example: A colleague who consistently helps others, listens actively, and performs their job well earns the respect of their peers.\par
Outcome: This leads to deep, lasting respect. It fosters a positive and collaborative environment where respect is mutual and well-founded.\par
In essence, demanding respect often results in fear or resentment, commanding respect arises from inherent qualities and behavior, and earning respect is built over time through consistent, respectful actions.\par
Not Demanding Respect\par
Not Forcing Respect: This  emphasizes that you are not insisting on being respected through forceful means. You're not using your authority, threats, or ultimatums to make others respect you.\par
Avoiding Aggression: It suggests that you're not adopting an aggressive or entitled approach. You understand that demanding respect usually leads to superficial compliance rather than genuine admiration.\par
Command Respect\par
Inspiring Respect Naturally: This part of the sentence indicates that you will establish a presence or authority that naturally encourages others to respect you.\par
Confidence and Competence: It implies that through your confidence, competence, and integrity, you will inspire respect. People will recognize and appreciate your abilities and character without needing to be told to respect you.\par
Actions and Behavior: Your actions and behavior will speak for themselves. By demonstrating qualities such as fairness, knowledge, and decisiveness, you will command respect.\par
This highlights a balanced approach to respect. You're not resorting to force or aggression to gain respect. Instead, you rely on your natural ability to lead and inspire others through your actions and demeanor.\par
In essence, respect is something you will naturally garner through your conduct and professionalism, rather than something you need to demand or force from others. This approach is more likely to result in genuine and lasting respect from those around you.\par

1. INTRODUCTION \par
\ldblquote Leadership is intangible, hard to measure, and difficult to describe.  It's quality \par
would seem to stem from many factors.  But certainly they must include a measure \par
of inherent ability to control and direct, self-confidence based on expert knowledge, \par
initiative, loyalty, pride and sense of responsibility.  Inherent ability cannot be \par
instilled, but that which is latent or dormant can be developed.  Other ingredients can \par
be acquired.  They are not easily learned.  But leaders can be and are made.\rdblquote  \par
General C. B. Cates,  \par
19th Commandant of the Marine Corps \par
Lt. Gen. Lewis \ldblquote Chesty\rdblquote  Puller \par
Lt. Gen. Puller steadily worked his way up the ranks proving his outstanding \par
leadership qualities.  He received a direct commission and began collecting \par
awards for valor.  By the time he retired from the Marine Corps in 1951 he had \par
earned more awards than any Marine in history; five Navy Crosses, the \par
Distinguished Service Cross, the Silver Star, two Legions of Merit with \ldblquote V\rdblquote  device, \par
the Bronze star with \ldblquote V\rdblquote  device, the Bronze Star, the Air Medal and the Purple \par
Heart. \par
The traits and principles of leadership are the basic fundamentals that Marines \par
use to develop their own leadership abilities and that of their subordinates.  \par
There are 14 leadership traits and 11 leadership principles. \par

charge of the platoon and carries out the training schedule. \par
Decisiveness\par
Definition- Ability to make decisions promptly and to announce them in a clear, forceful manner. \par
Significance- The quality of character which guides a person to accumulate all available facts in a circumstance, weigh the facts, and choose and announce an alternative which seems best.

Unselfishness\par
Definition- Avoidance of providing for one\rquote s own comfort and personal advancement at the expense of others. \par

Example- A Marine keeping up on a 10-mile forced march even though he/she has blisters on both feet. \par
3. The 11 Leadership Principles\par
Know Yourself and Seek Self Improvement- This principle of leadership should be developed by the use of leadership traits.  \par
Evaluate yourself by using the leadership traits and determine your strengths and weaknesses.  - You can improve yourself in many ways.  To develop the techniques of this principle: - Make an honest evaluation of yourself to determine your strong and weak personal qualities - Seek the honest opinions of your friends or superiors - Learn by studying the causes for the success and failures of others - Develop a genuine interest in people - Master the art of effective writing and speech - Have a definite plan to achieve your goal \par
Be Technically And Tactically Proficient- A person who knows their job thoroughly and possesses a wide field of knowledge.  Before you can lead, you must be able to do the job. One must follow before one can leaded.  Tactical and technical competence can be learned from books and from on the job training.  To develop this leadership principle of being technically and tactically proficient, you should: - Know what is expected of you then expend time and energy on becoming proficient at those things - Form an attitude early on of seeking to learn more than is necessary - Observe and study the actions of capable leaders - Spend time with those people who are recognized as technically and tactically proficient at those things - Prepare yourself for the job of the leader at the next higher rank - Seek feedback from superiors, peers and subordinates \par
Know Your People And Look Out For Their Welfare- This is one of the most important of the leadership principles.  A leader must make a conscientious effort to observe his Marines and how they react to different situations.  A Marine who is nervous and lacks self-confidence should never be put in a situation where an important decision must be made.  This knowledge will enable you as the leader to determine when close supervision is required.  - To put this principle in to practice successfully you should: - Put your Marines welfare before you own - Be approachable - Encourage individual development - Know your unit\rquote s mental attitude; keep in touch with their thoughts - Ensure fair and equal distribution of rewards - Provide sufficient recreational time and insist on participation Keep Your Personnel Informed- Marines by nature are inquisitive. To promote efficiency and morale, a leader should inform the Marines in his unit of all happenings and give reasons why things are to be done.  This is accomplished ONLY IF time and security permits.  Informing your Marines of the situation makes them feel that they are a part of the team and not just a cog in a wheel.  Informed Marines perform better.   - The key to giving out information is to be sure that the Marines have enough information to do their job intelligently and to inspire their initiative, enthusiasm, loyalty, and convictions. - Techniques to apply this principle are: - Whenever possible, explain why tasks must be done and the plan to accomplish a task - Be alert to detect the spread of rumors.  Stop rumors by replacing them with the truth - Build morale and espirit de corps by publicizing information concerning successes of your unit - Keep your unit informed about current legislation and regulations affecting their pay, promotion, privileges, and other benefits \par
Set The Example- A leader who shows professional competence, courage and integrity sets high personal standards for himself before he can rightfully demand it from others.  Your appearance, attitude, physical fitness and personal example are all on display daily for the Marines and Sailors in your unit.  Remember, your Marines and Sailors reflect your image!  - Techniques for setting the example are to: - Show your subordinates that you are willing to do the same things you ask them to do - Maintain an optimistic outlook - Conduct yourself so that your personal habits are not open to criticism - Avoid showing favoritism to any subordinate - Delegate authority and avoid over supervision, in order to develop leadership among subordinates \par
- Leadership is taught by example \par
Ensure That The Task Is Understood, Supervised, and Accomplished  - Leaders must give clear, concise orders that cannot be misunderstood, and then by close supervision, ensure that these orders are properly executed.  Before you can expect your men to perform, they must know what is expected of them.     - The most important part of this principle is the accomplishment of the mission.  In order to develop this principle you should: - Issue every order as if it were your own - Use the established chain of command - Encourage subordinates to ask questions concerning any point in your orders or directives they do not understand - Question subordinates to determine if there is any doubt or misunderstanding in regard to the task to be accomplished - Supervise the execution of your orders - Exercise care and thought in supervision; over supervision will hurt initiative and create resentment, while under supervision will not get the job done \par
Train Your Marines And Sailors As A Team- Teamwork is the key to successful operations.  Teamwork is essential from the smallest unit to the entire Marine Corps.  As a leader, you must insist on teamwork from your Marines.  Train, play and operate as a team.  Be sure that each Marine knows his/her position and responsibilities within the team framework. - To develop the techniques of this principle you should:  - Stay sharp by continuously studying and training - Encourage unit participation in recreational and military events - Do not publicly blame an individual for the team\rquote s failure or praise just an individual for the team\rquote s success - Ensure that training is meaningful, and that the purpose is clear to all members of the command - Train your team based on realistic conditions - Insist that every person understands the functions of the other members of the team and the function of the team as part of the unit \par
Make Sound And Timely Decisions- The leader must be able to rapidly estimate a situation and make a sound decision based on that estimation.  Hesitation or a reluctance to make a decision leads subordinates to lose confidence in your abilities as a leader.  Loss of confidence in turn creates confusion and hesitation within the unit. - Techniques to develop this principle include: - Developing a logical and orderly thought process by practicing objective estimates of the situation - When time and situation permit planning for every possible event that can reasonably be foreseen - Considering the advice and suggestions of your subordinates before making decisions \par
- Considering the effects of your decisions on all members of your unit  \par
Develop A Sense Of Responsibility Among Your Subordinates- Another way to show your Marines you are interested in their welfare is to give them the opportunity for professional development.  Assigning tasks and delegating authority promotes mutual confidence and respect between leader and subordinates.  It also encourages subordinates to exercise initiative and to give wholehearted cooperation in accomplishment of unit tasks.  When you properly delegate authority, you demonstrate faith in your Marines and increase authority, and increase their desire for greater responsibilities.   - To develop this principle you should: - Operate through the chain of command  - Provide clear, well thought out directions - Give your subordinates frequent opportunities to perform duties normally performed by senior personnel - Be quick to recognize your subordinates\rquote  accomplishments when they demonstrate initiative and resourcefulness - Correct errors in judgment and initiative in a way, which will encourage the individual to try harder - Give advice and assistance freely when your subordinates request it - Resist the urge to micro manage - Be prompt and fair in backing subordinates - Accept responsibility willingly and insist that your subordinates live by the  same standard \par
Employ Your Command Within its Capabilities- A leader must have a thorough knowledge of the tactical and technical capabilities of the command.  Successful completion of a task depends upon how well you know your unit\rquote s capabilities.  If the task assigned is one that your unit has not been trained to do, failure is very likely to occur.  Failures lower your unit\rquote s morale and self esteem.  Seek out challenging tasks for your unit, but be sure that your unit is prepared for and has the ability to successfully complete the mission. - Techniques for development of this principle are to: - Avoid volunteering your unit for tasks that are beyond their capabilities - Be sure that tasks assigned to subordinates are reasonable - Assign tasks equally among your subordinates - Use the full capabilities of your unit before requesting assistance Seek Responsibilities And Take Responsibility- For professional development, you must actively seek out challenging assignments.  You must use initiative and sound judgment when trying to accomplish jobs that are required by your grade.  Seeking responsibilities also means that you take responsibility for your actions.  Regardless of the actions of your subordinates, the responsibility for decisions and their application falls \par
- Learn the duties of your immediate senior, and be prepared to accept the responsibilities of these duties - Seek a variety of leadership positions that will give you experience in accepting responsibility in different fields - Take every opportunity that offers increased responsibility - Perform every task, no matter whether it is top secret or seemingly trivial, to the best of your ability - Stand up for what you think is right.  Have courage in your convictions - Carefully evaluate a subordinate\rquote s failure before taking action against that subordinate - In the absence of orders, take the initiative to perform the actions you believe your senior would direct you to perform if present.\par
