Employee Signature: ___________________________________ Date: ___________
Printed Name: _______________________________________

Demanding Respect
Definition: Demanding respect involves insisting on being treated with respect, often through authoritative or forceful means.
Characteristics: This approach usually comes across as aggressive or entitled. The person may use their position of power, threats, or ultimatums to ensure they are respected.
Example: A manager might say, "You will respect me because I am your boss," without demonstrating why they deserve that respect.
Outcome: This often leads to superficial 
compliance rather than genuine respect. People may follow orders out of fear or obligation, but the underlying respect is not truly present.
Commanding Respect
Definition: Commanding respect means establishing a presence or authority that naturally encourages others to respect you.
Characteristics: This involves confidence, competence, and a strong sense of integrity. The individual does not need to ask for respect; their actions and demeanor inspire it.
Example: A leader who is decisive, knowledgeable, and fair might naturally command respect from their team without explicitly requesting it.
Outcome: This approach tends to result in genuine respect. People respect the individual because of their capabilities and the way they carry themselves.
Earning Respect

Definition: Earning respect involves gaining respect through actions, behavior, and how one treats others over time.
Characteristics: This is built on mutual understanding, trust, and consistent behavior. The person demonstrates respect for others and, in turn, earns respect.
Example: A colleague who consistently helps others, listens actively, and performs their job well earns the respect of their peers.
Outcome: This leads to deep, lasting respect. It fosters a positive and collaborative environment where respect is mutual and well-founded.
In essence, demanding respect often results in fear or resentment, commanding respect arises from inherent qualities and behavior, and earning respect is built over time through consistent, respectful actions.

I'm Not Demanding Respect
Not Forcing Respect: This part of the sentence emphasizes that you are not insisting on being respected through forceful means. You're not using your authority, threats, or ultimatums to make others respect you.
Avoiding Aggression: It suggests that you're not adopting an aggressive or entitled approach. You understand that demanding respect usually leads to superficial compliance rather than genuine admiration.
But I Will Command Respect
Inspiring Respect Naturally: This part of the sentence indicates that you will establish a presence or authority that naturally encourages others to respect you.

Confidence and Competence: It implies that through your confidence, competence, and integrity, you will inspire respect. People will recognize and appreciate your abilities and character without needing to be told to respect you.
Actions and Behavior: Your actions and behavior will speak for themselves. By demonstrating qualities such as fairness, knowledge, and decisiveness, you will command respect.
Putting It All Together
Balanced Approach: The sentence highlights a balanced approach to respect. You're not resorting to force or aggression to gain respect. Instead, you rely on your natural ability to lead and inspire others through your actions and demeanor.
In essence, you are saying that respect is something you will naturally garner through your conduct and professionalism, rather than something you need to demand or force 

from others. This approach is more likely to result in genuine and lasting respect from those around you.

my responsibilities don't stop when the workday ends.
While you're resting, I'm often still working. I'm handling financial planning, communicating with clients, solving unexpected problems, and making sure everything is ready for the next day. Think of it like being a coach of a sports team. While the players rest after practice, the coach is still planning strategies and preparing for the next game.
My goal is to support you and the team by ensuring everything runs smoothly and efficiently. By putting in these extra hours, I'm working to create a stable and successful environment where you can thrive and succeed. I want you to know that your hard work during the day is deeply appreciated, and my after-hours efforts are all about building a better future for all of us.
If you ever have questions or want to know more about what I do after hours, I'm always here to chat. Your understanding and support
